title: "An Inquiry into Faculty Activism"
---

Student activism is covered a lot
Faculty activism less so

Taking a recent petition as the departure point for the analysis, what factors influence faculty activism?
  How does tenure influence it? 
  How does department affiliation affect it? 

Clear that some departments made a more concerted effort - forwarded through listservs

Questions for future research: 
  How does participation vary based on type of petition? 
  What is the role of someone sending it through a faculty listserv?
