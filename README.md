# Rishi's Final Project

This is the repository for all the scripts and files used to conduct the analysis and build the website for my final project.  

Scripts
* 01 - Load data
* 02 - Data Wrangling
* 03 - Model
* Runfile

RMDs
* index.Rmd
* about.Rmd
* data_sources.Rmd

The folders Data + Graphics contain all of the datasets and plots generated in the analysis. 

Make sure that the folder `starting_data` is in the working directory before you execute the runfile. 


You can see the rendered example site [here](https://uc-cfss.github.io/fp-template/).
